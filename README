The script calc_nb_gromacs.py needs three files in input (in the folder cg_model):

traj.xtc (gromacs trajectory)
conf.gro (gromacs coordinate file)
topol.top (gromacs topology)
For now the script works on files for a Calpha, coarse-grained model. 

and a folder where the results will be stored (ene.txt and log.txt files). The format of the ene.txt file is 2 columns, the 1st is
the frame number, the second the nb energy (kJ/mol). log.txt file contains some print outs of what the script is doing.
Usage of the script is demonstrated in usage.sh
